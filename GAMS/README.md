### How do I use? ###

* Generate:  
When we get cvs files from MATLAB, we can use this to translate GAMS input file.
NOTICE the parameter setting and modify what you want.
* PSP_Frugal:  
Run for PSP_Frugal.
* PSP_Original:  
Run for PSP_Practical. The constraints are same as PSP_Practical.
* PSP_Original:  
Run for PSP_Practical. BUT the objective constraint is different.
In this case, the objective constraint is to MAXIMIZE region number NOT region value.
